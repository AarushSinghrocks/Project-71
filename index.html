        <p>Jesuits have been engaged in university teaching, research and scholarly publication almost since the foundation of the Society of Jesus. From astronomy to classical ballet, from the humanities to theology, Jesuits try to enter into the languages and discourses of their inherited or emerging cultures. They attempt to discover, shape, renew or promote human wisdom, while at the same time respecting the integrity of disciplined scholarship. They also seek to accompany in faith, the men and women moulded by the potent cultural forces inherent in the university as an institution.

            Today, approximately three thousand Jesuits work in nearly two hundred Jesuit institutions of higher learning, touching the lives of more than half a million students, while other Jesuits exercise this mission in other universities. This activity has an influence not only on the lives of students but goes beyond the university. Universities serve as major channels for social advancement for the poor. In and through universities, important debates take place about ethics, future directions for economics and politics, and the very meaning of human existence, and these debates shape our culture.

            The challenge today is to strengthen the specific character of each Jesuit institution both as Jesuit and as a University. The university connotes a fundamental autonomy, integrity and honesty of a place of serene and open search for and discussion of the truth. Its mission proper is its dedication to research, teaching and the various forms of cultural service, as the indispensable horizon and context for a genuine preservation, renewal and communication of knowledge and human values. The Jesuit character requires that the university act in harmony with the demands of the service of faith in the universal God and the promotion of justice. A faith that does justice must find expression in the life of the University.

            Jesuit universities have found ways to apply this both in the lives of students through outreach programmes of mutual contact and service with the poor, and in the central teaching, research and publication aims of the university. The challenge all Jesuit universities face is to find new perspectives and new areas for research, teaching and university extension services, by means of which they can contribute to the transformation of society towards more profound levels of justice and freedom.

            St. Xavier's strives to be a truly Jesuit University in these changing times of the 21st Century. Perhaps it is this which has earned it in 2013, an A grade with a high grade point of 3.63 out of 4 in the re-accrediation by the NAAC, an autonomous body linked to the University Grants Commission of India. For the last many years in a row, the national magazine INDIA TODAY has rated it high among the first 10 colleges in India. In the June 2000 issue and again in the June 2006 issue, St. Xavier's has been rated the best Arts College in India and the second best Science and Commerce College in the country. Several other publications have paid tribute to Xavier's. However, it is the lives our students lead and their contribution to humanity that are our best accolades.</p>

        <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">Was built in 1982</h5>
        <p class="text-muted text-left">In 1982 it brought St. Xavier's pre-eminence, as a stage where some of the best plays were enacted by some of the most renowned theatre people. After 1885, great occasions, like the Prize Distribution Day, demanded more space than the hall could provide. For these functions a large shamiana was erected in the open. It was built with the same purpose in mind, as the present auditorium has been built today- to meet the needs of a growing community of students. In the wake of communication and technological innovations all around, the Hall gradually became an anachronism. The heralder of this dynamic change is none other than the present principal of St. Xavier’s College Rev. Fr. P. C. Mathew, who saw the increasing demands for more space for the laboratories for physics and the need for shifting the computer centre to a more convenient location.</p>

            The canteen is a service that the school offers to all families who need their children to be attended during lunchtime, understanding this service, apart from a space to eat, as a complement of the educational activity, a space where we work for the integral education of our students at cultural, social, leisure and habits.

            The canteen service is framed within the Educational Project of the school and includes two different areas: the dining room and the activities that children carry out at midday hours, both under the control, surveillance and animation of the monitors.

            This service also aims to provide students with balanced nutrition, helping them live together during dinner and leisure activities. That is why, from the dining room, a healthy and balanced diet is encouraged, as well as correct eating habits.

            From the school we manage and coordinate the dining service at the level of registrations, cancellations, modifications and global operation and delegates, to the company HOSTESA, the management, the monitoring, the activities and the elaboration of the food.

            We have a fully equipped and self-sufficient kitchen to make the food of the students according to the meal plan proposed by the company according to the Guide to Healthy Eating at the school stage provided by the Generalitat of Catalonia and regularly reviewed by the CAP of Vilassar de Mar.

        <h1>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h1>

            Although remote learning is the most viable means of education today, students still fail to do it. There are hundreds of reasons why students can’t attend their online classes. Not all students have access to an electronic device. Given how modern and technology-driven the world is today, many of them still can’t afford to have one.

            And even when they have, access to a strong and stable internet connection is only available to cities and first-world countries. Students living in rural areas, especially those in far-flung places, can barely connect to the internet. And our students aren’t an exemption. Students think that it’s okay not to check-in since their classes are done online. They think that their attendance doesn’t matter anymore.Instead, they spend their time scrolling through their different social media accounts. Others choose to play, watch tv, or do any other activities not related to education.

            They start to get lazy checking in, doing their assignment and accomplishing their school tasks. They lack the motivation to attend their online classes because of the wrong notions that they have.Another reason for low student attendance is that teachers fail to motivate their students to attend their classes. In one way or another, they fail to establish a routine that will force their students to check in regularly.
